## Overview of Election Audit

The Colorado election commission requests an election audit of a local election.  This election audit analysis is to provide the commission the results:

- Total number of votes cast
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout
- Candidates' votes and percentage
- Winning candidate name, votes and percentage

## **Election-Audit Summary** 

This python code is used to analyze a local election and provide the results to the Colorado election commission.  This code can be possibly used for any election with some modifications. 

1. ##### The data file

   In the code, the data file was read from a fixed file name,

   `file_to_load = os.path.join( "Resources", "election_results.csv")`.

   We can change it for a user to type in the data file, so that we can use it for any files.

   `file_to_load = input("Please enter the election data file: ")`.



2. ##### The row number

   In the code, the candidate and the county are at the 3rd and 2nd position.
       `candidate_name = row[2]`
       `county_name = row[1]`

   For other elections, we need to examine the position of candidate and county and modify the code accordingly to read the correct names.
